In this talk I present Faer, a linear algebra library for Rust written with safety, performance and ease of use as foundational principles. It implements a variety of algorithms from dense and sparse linear algebra, as well as matrix-free algorithms, all based on state of the art methods. I also outline future plans for the project and how it intends to distinguish itself from other widely used libraries.
