With its unique combination of memory safety and performance, Rust is in a unique position to provide fast and reliable physics simulation for robotics. In this talk we explore the capabilities of the Rapier rigid-body physics engine, including joints based on a reduced-coordinates formulation, gyroscopic precession, inverse kinematics, URDF support, and more. We also provide an overview of our in-progress efforts toward a cross-platform multiphysics ecosystem for robotics on both the CPU and GPU.
