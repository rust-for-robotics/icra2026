<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">
  Rust for Robotics is not officially affiliated with the Rust Foundation.
</p>

This full-day workshop will cover the potential value of Rust to solve current challenges in robotics software development. Led by industry leaders, academics, and open-source contributors, the workshop will cover
- Rust's value proposition for robotics, 
- Adoption challenges with legacy systems, 
- Role in research and education, 
- The robotics Rust ecosystem, and 
- Potential for future growth. 
 
Participants, including those unfamiliar with Rust, will gain a better understanding of how Rust can aid in developing robust robotics systems through presentations, interactive code demonstrations, panels, and poster sessions. Targeting software engineers, researchers, educators, and students, this workshop is focused on helping progress the adoption and development of robotics software written in Rust, thereby helping catalyze a shift towards safer and more reliable autonomous systems.

This workshop will include 8 invited talks, a panel discussion, an "unconference" session, and a poster session.

### Why Rust for Robotics?

Rust has a number of features that make it particularly well-suited for robotics applications, including:

  </div>

  <div>
    <h5> Memory Safety</h5>
    Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without a garbage collector, reducing the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults, which are critical in real-time robotics applications.
  </div>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h5>Concurrency</h5>
    "Fearless concurrency" is a core trait of Rust and makes it remarkably easy to develop concurrent applications that handle intensive I/O operations efficiently.

  </div>

  <div>
    <h5>Multithreading</h5>
    Rust design makes it super easy to develop multithreaded applications. It's going to be a breath of fresh air compared to C/C++ MPI, or fighting against Python Global Interpreter Lock(GIL)

  </div>

  <div>
    <h5>Multi-Architecture Support</h5>
    Building an application compiled for a specific architecture has never been so easy!
  </div>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h5>Tooling</h5>
    Rust's tooling ecosystem is robust and user-friendly, making it easy to manage dependencies, build projects, and integrate with other systems. Tools like Cargo simplify package management and project setup, while Clippy and Rustfmt help maintain code quality and consistency.
