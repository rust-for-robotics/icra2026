The **Rust for Robotics** workshop at ICRA 2025 invites high-quality contributions that explore the use of **Rust** in robotics applications. Unlike other research-based workshops, poster submissions needn't include a novel research component, but rather well-built robotics projects completed in Rust. For example, this could include:
- Rust for real-time and embedded robotics systems
- Rust-based robotics middleware and frameworks
- Control, planning, and perception softwares using Rust
- Robotics industry applications and case studies using Rust
- Tooling, debugging, and ecosystem development for Rust in robotics
- Security and formal verification for Rust-based robotics software
- Benchmark of Rust-based robotics software with other programming languages (C++, Python, etc)
- Education tools and platforms for Rust in robotics. 

If possible, we recommend including a live demonstration of said library, system, or application.

TODO: How to advertise the "flash presentation" portion of the poster session. Probably don't want to advertise that till after the submission deadline?

## Submission Guidelines

Participants are invited to submit papers presenting Rust-related research or projects relevant to robotics. Submissions should be in the form of an extended abstract (maximum 4 pages in ICRA format, including references). Authors may also submit an optional 2-3 minute video presentation if their work involves visual elements (e.g., robot operations, visualizations).

Accepted papers will be published on the workshop website, and authors will be required to present a poster at the workshop (in-person or remotely).

Submission format:
- Extended abstract: maximum 4 pages (ICRA format, including references)
- Optional: 2-3 minute video presentation
- Template: [ICRA submission template](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/files/ieeeconf.zip)


## Submission Process

All submissions must be made to [OpenReview](todo make link). Submissions must include:
- Required: Upload a PDF containing the extended abstract.
- Optional: Upload a ZIP file (up to 100MB) with any supplementary material (such as a video presentation).

Please direct any questions to the workshop organizers at TODO.
